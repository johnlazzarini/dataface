# DataFace
### https://johnlazzarini.github.io/dataface/
A mockup of a web application that provides users with a suite of tools for analyzing, visualizing, and managing business data.

## Summary
This is a mock up for a comprehensive platform for tracking, visualizing, and analyzing data that businesses typically deal with.

I built this on top of a bootstrap framework, and extensively customized
the HTML and JavaScript files that accompanied it.

This prototype gives users a snapshot of what a fully developed business analysis platform could behave like, and does so by studying the "recent data" transmitted by a fictitious multi-device application that I'm calling "John's internship project".

## Plans for the future
The underlying code provided by the fine folks at Bootstrap is well documented, and is designed to easily accomodate back end functionality.

One could easily use SQL or SQLite to modify, store, and keep track of data in real time.  This can be achieved through a web application, for example, via a PHP file.

## DataFace as a demo for Rocket Software
I started this project as a demo to share with my Rocket Software interviewer.  I thought it would be fun to use the Rocket Software name and likeness here and there for context and immersion.  Those usages might fall under a legal grey area though, so I'll of course be removing any and all usages after the interview.
